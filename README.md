#GBH
Nothing much yet, just a playground for me to do graphic experiments.
At the moment this is capable of drawing the whole city with a stable 60 fps. :)

This project is aprox. 3 years old (somewhere from late 2007), so most of the code is rather ugly.
So half of the work I am doing on this is refactoring and cleaning... Yeah.

#Features that are working:
* Most of the slopes
* Animation with stable frame rate (aprox. equal to gta2, needs finetuning)

#Features that are NOT working right now:
* Lights
* Partial 3/4 sided slopes

#Features I want to implement:
* Dynamic day/night with shadows and proper lighting
